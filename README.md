# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 of BootCamp

#1.Overview of the school district analysis: 
  *The purpose of this analysis was to see what affect removing the math and reading scores of the 9th graders from Thomas High School would have on our data.  The reason   for this was because our friend Maria was notified there was academic dishonesty and some grades were altered.

#2.Results: 

  How is the district summary affected?
      From the tables below you can see by removing those scores the average math score and percentage of students who passsed math slightly decreased.  The first image is the ninth graders removed.  The second image they are included.

  How is the school summary affected?
      The school summary is not affected except for the 3 scores from Thomas High School that we removed.  
  How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  Replacing these scores still leaves Thomas High School as the second ranked school with regards to overall pass rate as seen from the images below.   The first image is the ninth graders removed.  The second image they are included.

  How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
  - This only affects the ninth grade and brought them slightly lower for both.
Scores by school spending
  Thomas High School was still in the $631-$646 spending range bin even after removing the ninth graders.
Scores by school size
  -Thomas High School was stil in the middle for school size and didn't change.
 Scores by school type
  -The Charter school type was unaffected by this change (if we went into a decimal place we might have seen this change.
##3.Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.  Some changes after dropping the scores after we replaced the ninth grade reading and math scores were the % who passed math dropped by about .1%.  The % who passed reading dropped about .3%.  The overall percentage who passed dropped also dropped about .3%.
