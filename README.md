# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 of BootCamp

##1.Overview of the school district analysis: 
  The purpose of this analysis was to see what affect removing the math and reading scores of the 9th graders from Thomas High School would have on our data.  The reason   for this was because our friend Maria was notified there was academic dishonesty and some grades were altered.

##2.Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

-How is the district summary affected?
  From the tables below you can see by removing those scores the total number of students obviously dropped, and the average math score and percentage of students who     passsed math slightly decreased.
